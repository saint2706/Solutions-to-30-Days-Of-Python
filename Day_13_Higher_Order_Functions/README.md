# 📘 Day 13: Higher-Order Functions & Lambda

A **higher-order function** is a function that takes another function as an argument or returns a function as its result. This is a powerful concept used heavily in data analysis for its conciseness and flexibility.

## Key Higher-Order Functions

*   **`map(function, iterable)`:** Applies a function to every item in an iterable (e.g., a list).
*   **`filter(function, iterable)`:** Creates a new iterable containing only the items for which the function returns `True`.
*   **`sorted(iterable, key=function)`:** Sorts an iterable. The `key` argument takes a function that specifies what to sort by.

## Lambda Functions: Quick, Anonymous Functions

A **lambda function** is a small, anonymous function defined with the `lambda` keyword. They are perfect for use with higher-order functions when you need a simple, one-off function.

`lambda arguments: expression`

```python
# The 'for' loop way
new_salaries = []
for s in salaries:
    new_salaries.append(s * 1.10)

# The map and lambda way
new_salaries = list(map(lambda s: s * 1.10, salaries))
```

## Environment Setup

Before you begin, ensure you have followed the setup instructions in the main [README.md](../../README.md) to set up your virtual environment and install the required libraries.

## Exploring the Refactored Code

The script for this lesson, `HOF.py`, has been refactored to place each higher-order function task into its own testable function.

1.  **Review the Code:** Open `Day_13_Higher_Order_Functions/HOF.py`. Notice the functions `apply_bonus_to_salaries()`, `filter_high_yield_projects()`, and `sort_products_by_attribute()`.
2.  **Run the Script:** From the root directory of the project (`Coding-For-MBA`), run the script to see the functions in action:
    ```bash
    python Day_13_Higher_Order_Functions/HOF.py
    ```
3.  **Run the Tests:** You can run the tests for this lesson to verify the correctness of each function:
    ```bash
    pytest tests/test_day_13.py
    ```

## 💻 Exercises: Day 13

1.  **Standardize Department Names:**
    *   In a new script (`my_solutions_13.py`), create a list of department names: `departments = ["Sales", " marketing ", "  Engineering", "HR  "]`.
    *   Write a function that takes this list and uses `map` with a `lambda` function to return a new list where each name is cleaned (whitespace stripped) and converted to lowercase.
    *   Call your function and print the result.

2.  **Filter Active Subscriptions:**
    *   You have a list of customer dictionaries (see below).
    *   Import the `get_active_customer_names` function from the lesson script.
    *   Call the function with the customer list and print the names of the active customers.
        ```python
        customers = [
            {"name": "Cust A", "subscription_status": "active"},
            {"name": "Cust B", "subscription_status": "inactive"},
            {"name": "Cust C", "subscription_status": "active"}
        ]
        ```

3.  **Sort Complex Data:**
    *   You have a list of product dictionaries.
    *   Import the `sort_products_by_attribute` function.
    *   Call the function twice: once to sort the products by `"price"` and once to sort them by `"name"`. Print both sorted lists.
        ```python
        products = [
            {"name": "Laptop", "price": 1200},
            {"name": "Mouse", "price": 25},
            {"name": "Keyboard", "price": 75}
        ]
        ```

🎉 **Congratulations!** Higher-order functions and lambdas are a gateway to a more powerful style of programming that you will see everywhere in the world of data science.
