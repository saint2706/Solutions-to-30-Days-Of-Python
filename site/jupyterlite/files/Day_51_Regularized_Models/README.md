# Day 51 – Regularised Models

This lesson extends the regression toolkit with L2 (ridge), L1 (lasso), and
elastic net penalties before introducing generalised linear models (GLMs). The
core notebook and `solutions.py` module walk through the following:

- Building a reproducible synthetic regression dataset and benchmarking ridge,
  lasso, and elastic net pipelines with cross-validation.
- Measuring coefficient shrinkage to understand how regularisation combats
  overfitting and highlights the most important predictors.
- Training a Poisson regression GLM for count outcomes so you can generalise
  linear modelling concepts beyond ordinary least squares.

Run `python Day_51_Regularized_Models/solutions.py` to execute the full demo and
review the printed comparison table.
