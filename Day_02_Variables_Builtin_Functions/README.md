# 📘 Day 2: Storing and Analyzing Business Data

In Day 1, we performed basic calculations. Now, we'll learn how to store data in **variables** and use Python's **built-in functions** to analyze it.

## What is a Variable?

A variable is a labeled container for information. Instead of using a raw number like `500000`, we can store it in a variable called `revenue`, making our code more readable and manageable.

**`revenue = 500000`**

### Naming Conventions

*   **Be Descriptive:** `quarterly_sales` is better than `qs`.
*   **Use Snake Case:** Separate words with underscores, like `cost_of_goods_sold`.

## Built-in Functions: Your Basic Toolkit

Python includes pre-built functions for common tasks:
*   `len()`: Finds the length (e.g., number of items in a list).
*   `sum()`: Calculates the sum of numbers in a list.
*   `min()` and `max()`: Find the minimum and maximum values.
*   `round()`: Rounds a number to a specified number of decimal places.

## Environment Setup

Before you begin, ensure you have followed the setup instructions in the main [README.md](../../README.md) to set up your virtual environment and install the required libraries.

## Exploring the Refactored Code

The script for this lesson, `variables.py`, has been refactored into functions to promote code reuse and testability.

1.  **Review the Code:** Open `Day_02_Variables_Builtin_Functions/variables.py`. Notice how the logic is now organized into functions like `display_company_profile()` and `analyze_weekly_sales()`.
2.  **Run the Script:** From the root directory of the project (`Coding-For-MBA`), run the script:
    ```bash
    python Day_02_Variables_Builtin_Functions/variables.py
    ```
    You will see the output from the example scenarios defined at the bottom of the script.
3.  **Run the Tests:** You can also run the tests for this lesson to see how we verify the functions' correctness:
    ```bash
    pytest tests/test_day_02.py
    ```

## 💻 Exercises: Day 2

1.  **Company Profile Variables:**
    *   In a new Python script (`my_solutions_02.py`), declare variables for a fictional company: `company_name`, `year_founded`, `current_revenue`, and `is_publicly_traded`.
    *   Print each of these variables with a descriptive label.

2.  **Sales Analysis:**
    *   A list of sales transactions is: `[150.50, 200.00, 75.25, 300.75, 120.00]`.
    *   Store these in a variable called `weekly_sales`.
    *   Use built-in functions to calculate and print:
        *   The total number of sales (`len()`).
        *   The total revenue (`sum()`).
        *   The smallest and largest sales (`min()`, `max()`).
        *   The average sale amount.

3.  **Profit Calculator Function:**
    *   Create a function `calculate_profit(revenue, expenses)` that takes two numbers and returns the difference.
    *   Call this function with some example numbers (e.g., `calculate_profit(50000, 35000)`) and print the result.

🎉 **Well done!** You've learned how to store data in variables and use Python's built-in functions for analysis—foundational skills for everything that comes next.
