# 📘 Day 17: Regular Expressions for Text Pattern Matching

Often, the text data you need to analyze isn't perfectly structured. You might need to find all the invoice numbers in a document, extract all email addresses from a messy text block, or validate that a product code follows a specific format. For these tasks, we use **regular expressions** (regex).

## What is a Regular Expression?

A regular expression is a special sequence of characters that defines a search pattern. It's like a mini-language for finding and manipulating text. While it can look intimidating at first, a few key patterns can solve most common business problems.

*   `\d+`: Matches one or more digits (e.g., `123`).
*   `[a-z]+`: Matches one or more lowercase letters.
*   `\s`: Matches a whitespace character.
*   `\b`: Matches a word boundary.
*   `[]`: Defines a character set (e.g., `[abc]` matches 'a', 'b', or 'c').
*   `[^...]`: Matches anything *not* in the character set.

## Environment Setup

Before you begin, ensure you have followed the setup instructions in the main [README.md](../../README.md) to set up your virtual environment and install the required libraries.

## Exploring the Refactored Code

The script for this lesson, `regex.py`, has been refactored to place each regex task into its own testable function.

1.  **Review the Code:** Open `Day_17_Regular_Expressions/regex.py`. Examine functions like `find_most_common_words()`, `extract_and_analyze_numbers()`, `is_valid_python_variable()`, and `clean_text_advanced()`.
2.  **Run the Script:** From the root directory of the project (`Coding-For-MBA`), run the script to see the functions in action:
    ```bash
    python Day_17_Regular_Expressions/regex.py
    ```
3.  **Run the Tests:** You can run the tests for this lesson to verify the correctness of each regex function:
    ```bash
    pytest tests/test_day_17.py
    ```

## 💻 Exercises: Day 17

1.  **Extract All Numbers from a String:**
    *   In a new script (`my_solutions_17.py`), you have a string: `text = "Order #123 was placed for $49.99. The order contains 3 items."`
    *   Import the `extract_and_analyze_numbers` function from the lesson script. Note that it only extracts integers. Can you modify the regex inside it to extract floating-point numbers as well?
    *   Call the function and print the extracted numbers.

2.  **Validate a Product Code:**
    *   A valid product code must follow the format `PROD-XXXX`, where `X` is a digit.
    *   Create a function `is_valid_product_code(code)` that returns `True` if the code is valid and `False` otherwise.
    *   Use the `re.fullmatch(pattern, string)` function. Your pattern should look something like `r'PROD-\d{4}'`. (`\d{4}` means exactly four digits).
    *   Test your function with `"PROD-1234"` (valid) and `"PROD-123"` (invalid).

3.  **Clean Up a Messy Sentence:**
    *   You have a sentence with extra symbols: `sentence = "Contact us... at (support@example.com)!"`
    *   Import and use the `clean_text_advanced` function from the lesson to remove the punctuation and symbols.
    *   Print the cleaned sentence.

🎉 **Excellent!** Regular expressions are a fundamental tool for any data analyst who works with text. They provide a powerful and efficient way to clean, validate, and extract information from unstructured data.
