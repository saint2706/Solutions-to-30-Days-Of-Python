# 📘 Day 14: Modules - Organizing Your Business Logic

As your projects grow, you need a way to organize your code. In Python, we do this with **modules**. A module is simply a Python file (`.py`) containing functions and variables. By grouping related functions into modules, you create a clean, maintainable, and scalable project.

## Why Use Modules?

*   **Organization:** Keeps related code together (e.g., all financial calculations in `financials.py`).
*   **Reusability:** Import your custom modules into any project.
*   **Readability:** Makes your main script shorter and easier to understand.

## How to Import Modules

**1. Import the entire module (recommended):**
This is the most common way. You access functions using the `module_name.function_name` syntax.

```python
import business_logic as bl
roi = bl.calculate_roi(50000, 10000)
```

**2. Import a specific function:**
If you only need one or two functions from a large module.

```python
from business_logic import calculate_roi
roi = calculate_roi(50000, 10000)
```

## Python's Built-in Modules

Python comes with a huge **Standard Library** of built-in modules, including:
*   `math`: For advanced mathematical functions (`math.sqrt()`).
*   `datetime`: Essential for working with dates and times.
*   `random`: For generating random numbers (useful for sampling).

## Environment Setup

Before you begin, ensure you have followed the setup instructions in the main [README.md](../../README.md) to set up your virtual environment and install the required libraries.

## Exploring the Refactored Code

The code for this lesson is split into two files:
*   `business_logic.py`: A module containing reusable functions.
*   `modules.py`: The main script that imports and uses the `business_logic` module.

We have refactored `modules.py` to wrap its logic in functions and deleted a redundant, unused module file.

1.  **Review the Code:** Open both `Day_14_Modules/business_logic.py` and `Day_14_Modules/modules.py`. See how the main script imports and uses the functions defined in the module.
2.  **Run the Script:** From the root directory of the project (`Coding-For-MBA`), run the main script:
    ```bash
    python Day_14_Modules/modules.py
    ```
3.  **Run the Tests:** You can run the tests for this lesson to verify the correctness of the functions in the `business_logic` module:
    ```bash
    pytest tests/test_day_14.py
    ```

## 💻 Exercises: Day 14

1.  **Create Your Own Module:**
    *   Create a new file named `text_tools.py`.
    *   Inside this file, define a function `count_characters(text)` that returns the length of a string.
    *   Create a second file, `main_report.py`.
    *   In `main_report.py`, import your `text_tools` module and use your function to count the characters in a sample sentence.

2.  **Use the `datetime` Module:**
    *   In a new script, `import` the `datetime` module.
    *   Get the current date and time using `datetime.datetime.now()`.
    *   Print the current date.
    *   Print just the current year from the date object (e.g., `my_date.year`).

3.  **Use the `math` Module:**
    *   A company's sales are growing by the square root of its marketing budget.
    *   `import` the `math` module.
    *   Create a variable `marketing_budget = 100000`.
    *   Use `math.sqrt()` to calculate the growth factor and print the result.

🎉 **Well done!** You've learned how to organize your code into modules. This is a critical skill for building any project that's more than a few dozen lines long.
